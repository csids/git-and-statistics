Because it is specifically designed for collaborative coding. In more concrete terms, this means:\n\nIt allows us to easily collaborate on code together.\n\nTraditional cloud storage services push all changes instantaneously. This has a tendency to break code.\n\nConflicts are handled in a well-defined manner that makes sense for code.\n\nTraditional cloud storage services do not handle this as well — they just save both files side-by-side.\n\nIt allows for the retrieval of earlier versions of code.\nCan easily check how each file/line of code has developed over time.\n\nTraditional cloud storage services have limited versioning options.\n\nIt provides a secure remote storage space for the code, in case of laptop theft/damage.\n\nSame as traditional cloud storage services.\n\nAccess rights can be centrally controlled on a per-project basis.\n\nIf working within a GitHub organization, then access rights should be given via teams."
